Sass Burger
===========

A Sass mixin for creating hamburger icons.

## Usage

Take a look at the demo and the burger.scss file, it should be pretty self-explanatory.

**!!! This mixin doesn't take care of vendor prefixes**, I recommend that you use something like [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer).
